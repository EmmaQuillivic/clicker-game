# clicker-game
In this project, I've built a simple yet addictive clicker game using JavaScript. This game allows players to accumulate points by clicking and invest those points to generate more points per second. Here's a quick overview of what this project entails:

## Project Overview

**Step 1: The Basics**
In the first step, I created a basic HTML file along with JavaScript and CSS. I implemented a click function that allows players to earn foods with each click. The player's current foods count is displayed on the screen.

**Step 2: Automators**
In this step, I introduced automated foods generation, which I refer to as "GPS" (Gain Per Second). Players can accumulate food even when they're not actively clicking. I also added weapons to the game, which players can purchase to increase their GPS.

**Step 3: The Shop**
Step 3 involved creating a shop where players can spend their hard-earned food to purchase weapons. I implemented the buying functionality and ensured that it updates the player's food and GPS accordingly.

**Step 4: Enhancements**
I didn't stop at the basics. In this step, I added some exciting enhancements to the gameplay. Weapon costs increase with each purchase, making the game more challenging. I also introduced bonuses, such as doubling the click value and GPS at specific milestones.

**Step 5: Save Progress**
To enhance the player experience, I added a progress-saving feature using local storage. Players can now continue their game even after closing the browser.
